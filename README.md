## 🔧 Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- **Command not found**: Ensure the shell executable is in your PATH
- **Permission denied**: Make sure the executable has proper permissions (`chmod +x xshell`)
- **Build errors**: Verify all dependencies are installed and up to date

### Windows-specific Issues
- When using MinGW, you may need to use `mingw32-make` instead of `make`
- In WSL, ensure you're using a compatible Linux distribution
